Please run the executable .exe file. The Java binary .jar file is optional and works, but doesn't have a spash screen or logo which are cool (therefore recommended to run the .exe using WINE even on non-Windows systems, but if anyone is willing to help test executables on other systems that'd be appreciated).
Please don't change the files in the directory unless you really know what you're doing and if you found a bug or have a feature request please file it at https://github.com/chickenCabbage/PRUN/issues, thanks.
